# Project-Sex-Prediction

Use a decision tree and feed it some data about sizes from males and females, then you give it some sample data to be evaluated by it.
Use multiple models, for the sake of trying out, try to find sample values that make that different models ouput different results.

## GaussianProcessClassifier
    -Abr. GP(C)
    -designed to solve regression and probabilistic classification problems

## RandomForestClassifier
    -Abr. RF(C)
    -Builds multiple decision trees (->Forest) and merges them together. By merging RandomForests this achieves reduced variance in the results.
